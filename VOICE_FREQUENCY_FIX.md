# ✅ Fixed: Multiple Voice Comments

## 🐛 Problem
Only 1 voice comment was being generated, then it stopped.

## 🔍 Root Causes

### 1. Missing `.env` Loading
```python
# BEFORE: .env file not loaded
# ElevenLabs API key not being read

# AFTER: Added dotenv loading
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

# Now ELEVENLABS_API_KEY is properly loaded
```

### 2. Commentary Too Infrequent
```python
# BEFORE: Every 3 frames with 3s sampling
if idx % 3 == 0:  # Frames 0, 3, 6, 9
    # Only 3-4 commentaries for 30s video

# AFTER: Every 2 frames, skip first
if idx % 2 == 0 and idx > 0:  # Frames 2, 4, 6, 8
    # 4-5 commentaries for 30s video
```

### 3. Poor Logging
```python
# BEFORE: Minimal logging
print(f"🎙️ Commentary: {commentary}")

# AFTER: Detailed logging
print(f"🔍 Frame {idx}: Should generate commentary? {should_generate_commentary}")
print(f"🎙️ Commentary generated: {commentary}")
print(f"🎤 Attempting voice generation for frame {idx}...")
print(f"✅ Voice generated! Audio URL: {audio_url}")
```

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Load `.env` File
**File:** `app.py` (line 27-30)
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()
```

### 2. Increase Commentary Frequency
**File:** `app.py` (line 892)
```python
# Commentary now at frames 2, 4, 6, 8 (every 2 frames)
should_generate_commentary = (idx % 2 == 0 and idx > 0)
```

### 3. Add Detailed Logging
**File:** `app.py` (line 893, 918-927)
```python
print(f"🔍 Frame {idx}: Should generate commentary? {should_generate_commentary}")
print(f"🎙️ Commentary generated: {commentary}")
print(f"🎤 Attempting voice generation for frame {idx}...")

if audio_url:
    print(f"✅ Voice generated! Audio URL: {audio_url}")
else:
    print(f"❌ Voice generation failed for frame {idx}")
```

### 4. Simplified Voice Generation
**File:** `app.py` (line 574-614)
```python
# Removed signal.alarm() (doesn't work on macOS)
# Direct voice generation with better error handling
audio_generator = elevenlabs_client.text_to_speech.convert(...)
```

## 🎯 New Behavior

### 30-Second Video (10 frames):
```
Frame 0 (0s):  ❌ Skipped (idx=0)
Frame 1 (3s):  ❌ Skipped (idx%2=1)
Frame 2 (6s):  ✅ Commentary + Voice 🔊
Frame 3 (9s):  ❌ Skipped (idx%2=1)
Frame 4 (12s): ✅ Commentary + Voice 🔊
Frame 5 (15s): ❌ Skipped (idx%2=1)
Frame 6 (18s): ✅ Commentary + Voice 🔊
Frame 7 (21s): ❌ Skipped (idx%2=1)
Frame 8 (24s): ✅ Commentary + Voice 🔊
Frame 9 (27s): ❌ Skipped (idx%2=1)

Total: 4 voice commentaries
```

## 📊 Expected Console Output

### When It Works:
```bash
🎬 Processing frame 2/10 at 6.0s
🔍 Frame 2: Should generate commentary? True (idx=2, idx%2=0)
📝 Generating contextual commentary for frame 2...
🎙️ Commentary generated: People at an amusement park outdoor area
🎤 Attempting voice generation for frame 2...
🎤 Converting to speech: People at an amusement park outdoor...
🔊 Voice audio saved: commentary_6000.mp3
✅ Voice generated! Audio URL: /audio/commentary_6000.mp3

🎬 Processing frame 4/10 at 12.0s
🔍 Frame 4: Should generate commentary? True (idx=4, idx%2=0)

### If Voice Fails:
```bash
🎤 Attempting voice generation for frame 2...
⚠️ Voice disabled: client=False, text=True
❌ Voice generation failed for frame 2
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Voice at All?

1. **Check .env is loaded:**
   ```bash
   # In server console on startup, should see:
   🎙️ ElevenLabs TTS initialized - Voice commentary enabled!
   
   # If you see instead:
   💡 Set ELEVENLABS_API_KEY in .env to enable voice commentary
   # Then .env is not being loaded
   ```

2. **Verify API key:**
   ```bash
   # Check .env file contains:
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=sk_aa2cfbc008370fbf7490d2d46dd95062aa7be6547eed4069
   ```

3. **Check audio folder exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -la audio_commentary/
   # Should exist and be writable
   ```

### Only 1 Voice?

**Check console logs:**
```bash
# Should see multiple:
🔍 Frame 2: Should generate commentary? True
🔍 Frame 4: Should generate commentary? True
🔍 Frame 6: Should generate commentary? True

# If you only see:
🔍 Frame 2: Should generate commentary? True
# Then something is stopping after first commentary
```

**Possible causes:**
- ElevenLabs API rate limit hit
- Audio generation throwing exception
- Check for errors after first voice generation

### Voice Generated But Not Playing?

**Check browser console:**
```javascript
// Should see:
🔊 Playing voice commentary: /audio/commentary_6000.mp3

// If error:
Audio play failed: [error message]
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check audio URL is accessible: `http://localhost:5000/audio/commentary_6000.mp3`
2. Verify browser allows audio autoplay
3. Check volume is not muted

## ✅ Summary

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Added `.env` loading with `load_dotenv()`
2. ✅ Increased commentary frequency (every 2 frames)
3. ✅ Added detailed logging for debugging
4. ✅ Simplified voice generation (removed signal.alarm)

### Expected Results:
- **4-5 voice commentaries** per 30s video
- **Detailed console logs** showing each step
- **Clear error messages** if voice fails
- **Graceful degradation** if API issues

### Test Now:
```bash
# Restart server
python3 app.py

# Look for:
🎙️ ElevenLabs TTS initialized - Voice commentary enabled!

# Then test video and watch console for:
🔍 Frame 2: Should generate commentary? True
🎤 Attempting voice generation for frame 2...
✅ Voice generated! Audio URL: /audio/commentary_6000.mp3
```

**Voice should now play multiple times throughout the video! 🔊**

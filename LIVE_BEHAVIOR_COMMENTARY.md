# ✅ Live Behavior Commentary - Narrating Actions

## 🎯 Problem Fixed:

### Issue: Commentary Felt Static, Not Like Behavior
**Before:** "The athlete launches himself high into the air at the theme park" (static description)  
**After:** "The athlete is building up speed as he runs forward, now launching his body upward into a full rotation while the theme park crowd below erupts in excitement" (live action narration)

---

## 🔧 Changes Made:

### 1. **AI Prompt - Behavior Focused**

**Before (Static Description):**
```python
"Describe the action with rich details"
"Paint a picture with sensory details"
Examples: "{name} launches himself high into the air..."
```

**After (Live Behavior Narration):**
```python
"Narrate what's happening RIGHT NOW"
"Describe the behavior and action unfolding"
"NARRATE the actual behavior like you're watching it happen"

Examples:
- "{name} is building up speed as he runs forward, now launching his body upward into a full rotation while the theme park crowd below erupts in excitement"
- "Watch {name} taking off with explosive power, his legs driving him skyward as he tucks into that backflip while spectators pull out their phones to capture this moment"
- "Here comes {name} sprinting toward the launch point, and there he goes - body extended mid-air as he executes the flip with the park's rides spinning in the background"

Focus on: the behavior happening, the action sequence, what he's doing right now, crowd reaction
```

### 2. **Fallback Commentary - Live Action**

**Before (Static):**
```python
"The athlete launches himself high into the air at the theme park, executing an impressive acrobatic move while spectators watch from below"
```

**After (Present Continuous - Happening Now):**
```python
"The athlete is launching upward now, legs pushing off as his body rotates through the air at the theme park while the crowd below reacts to this athletic display"

"Here we see the athlete building momentum, now taking off with explosive force as he tucks into that flip with 15 spectators capturing the action on their devices"

"Watch this - the athlete springs into the air, body extended as he executes the rotation above the theme park while onlookers stop to witness this acrobatic moment"
```

## 📊 Key Differences:

### OLD Style (Static Descriptions):
```
❌ "The athlete launches himself" (past/completed)
❌ "executes a move" (static description)
❌ "pulls off a flip" (accomplished fact)
❌ Focus: What happened (static)
```

### NEW Style (Live Behavior Narration):
```
✅ "The athlete is launching" (present continuous)
✅ "now taking off" (happening now)
✅ "body rotating through the air" (ongoing action)
✅ "crowd below reacts" (live response)
✅ Focus: What's happening RIGHT NOW (dynamic)
```

## 🎙️ Commentary Examples:

### AI-Generated (Live Behavior):
```
"IShowSpeed is building up speed as he runs forward, now launching his body upward into a full rotation while the theme park crowd below erupts in excitement"

"Watch IShowSpeed taking off with explosive power, his legs driving him skyward as he tucks into that backflip while spectators pull out their phones to capture this moment"

"Here comes IShowSpeed sprinting toward the launch point, and there he goes - body extended mid-air as he executes the flip with the park's rides spinning in the background"
```

### Fallback (Live Action Narration):
```
"The athlete is launching upward now, legs pushing off as his body rotates through the air at the theme park while the crowd below reacts to this athletic display"

"Here we see the athlete building momentum, now taking off with explosive force as he tucks into that flip with 15 spectators capturing the action on their devices"

"The athlete is driving forward with speed, now launching skyward into a full backflip as the theme park crowd erupts and phones come out to record this spectacular move"
```

### Scene Narration (No Action):
```
"The athlete is making his way through the theme park right now, weaving among 15 people as fun and excitement surrounds the scene and energy fills the air"

"We're watching the athlete navigate this lively amusement park environment, moving past 15 spectators while activity creates a vibrant atmosphere all around"

"The camera is tracking the athlete as he moves through the packed theme park, interacting with the crowd of 15 while fun adds to this energetic moment"
```

- ✅ "is building" (not "builds")
- ✅ "is taking off" (not "takes off")
- ✅ "is making his way" (not "moves")

### 2. **Action Sequences:**
- ✅ "building up speed" → "now launching"
- ✅ "sprinting toward" → "and there he goes"
- ✅ "legs pushing off" → "body rotates"
- ✅ Shows progression of behavior

### 3. **Live Reactions:**
- ✅ "crowd below reacts"
- ✅ "spectators pull out their phones"
- ✅ "onlookers stop to witness"
- ✅ "crowd erupts"

### 4. **Narration Words:**
- ✅ "Watch this -"
- ✅ "Here we see"
- ✅ "There he goes"
- ✅ "Right now"
- ✅ Makes it feel like live TV

### 5. **Body Details:**
- ✅ "legs pushing off"
- ✅ "body rotating"
- ✅ "body extended"

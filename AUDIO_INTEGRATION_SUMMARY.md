# ✅ Audio Integration Complete!

## 🎉 What's Been Added

Your StreamBet counter now has **audio-aware AI commentary** using AWS SageMaker's Whisper Large V3 Turbo!

### Features Implemented:
- ✅ **Audio extraction** from video segments
- ✅ **Speech-to-text** transcription via SageMaker
- ✅ **Enhanced commentary** that references what was said
- ✅ **Context-aware AI** combining visual + audio data
- ✅ **Automatic cleanup** of temporary audio files
- ✅ **Graceful fallback** if audio unavailable

---

## 📊 How It Works

### Current Flow:
```
Video Upload
    ↓
Frame Extraction (every 1s)
    ↓
For every 3rd frame:
    ├─→ Rekognition Analysis (visual)
    ├─→ Audio Extraction (5s segment)
    ├─→ Whisper Transcription (speech-to-text)
    └─→ Bedrock Commentary (combines all context)
```

### What the AI Now Sees:
1. **Visual:** Objects, people, actions (Rekognition labels)
2. **Identity:** Celebrity recognition (if available)
3. **Audio:** What was said in the video (Whisper transcription)
4. **History:** Previous 3 frames for context
5. **Query:** User's question about the video

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy Whisper Endpoint

**Option A: AWS Console (Easiest)**
1. Go to: https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/home?region=ap-southeast-2#/jumpstart
2. Search: `whisper-large-v3-turbo`
3. Click **Deploy**
4. Choose `ml.g5.xlarge`
5. Wait 5-10 minutes

**Option B: Use Script**
```bash
python3 deploy_whisper_endpoint.py
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment

Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
WHISPER_ENDPOINT_NAME=your-endpoint-name-here
```

### Step 3: Test!

```bash
# Restart server
python3 app.py

# You should see:
# ✅ AWS clients initialized successfully
# 🤖 Bedrock AI available - AI commentary enabled
# 🎤 SageMaker Runtime ready for Whisper ASR
# 🎙️ Whisper ASR endpoint configured: your-endpoint-name
# 🎙️ Audio analysis enabled for enhanced commentary
```

## 📝 Example Output

### Before (Visual Only):
```
📊 Frame 3: Person, Amusement Park, Fun...
🤖 AI: "Yes - 1 (Amusement Park)"
🎙️ Commentary: "Action at the theme park! Something exciting is happening!"
```

### After (Visual + Audio):
```
📊 Frame 3: Person, Amusement Park, Fun...
🎤 Transcribing audio around 3.0s...
🎙️ Heard: "Let's go! I'm about to do something crazy!"
🤖 AI: "Yes - 1 (Amusement Park)"  
🎙️ Commentary: "IShowSpeed is pumping up the crowd - something big is coming!"
```

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Current Setup Costs:
| Service | Usage | Cost |
|---------|-------|------|
| **Rekognition** | $1 per 1000 images | $0.03/video (30 frames) |
| **Bedrock (Titan)** | $0.80/$2.40 per 1M tokens | $0.005/video |
| **Whisper (SageMaker)** | $1/hour (ml.g5.xlarge) | $1/hour |
| **Total** | Per 30s video | **$0.035 + $1/hour endpoint** |

### Cost Optimization:
- ✅ **Delete endpoint** when not in use
- ✅ **Transcribe every 3rd frame** (already implemented)
- ✅ **Use spot instances** for SageMaker (50-70% cheaper)
- ✅ **Skip audio** for queries that don't need it

### Monthly Estimate:
- **Without audio:** $10/month (1000 videos)
- **With audio (8hrs/day):** $250/month
- **Production (24/7):** $750/month

## 🎯 Use Cases Enhanced by Audio

### 1. StreamBet Betting Scenarios:
```
❌ Before: "Is someone on screen?"
✅ After: "Did they say 'Let's go!'?"
```

### 2. Content Moderation:
```
❌ Before: Visual labels only
✅ After: Detect banned words/phrases
```

### 3. Highlight Detection:
```
❌ Before: Detect action visually
✅ After: "Did they say 'GOAL!' or scream?"
```

### 4. Engagement Metrics:
```
❌ Before: Count people
✅ After: Measure crowd noise/excitement
```

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Audio Segment Duration
```python
# In app.py, extract_audio_segment()
audio_start = max(0, start_time - duration/2)  # Default: 5s
audio_end = min(video.duration, start_time + duration/2)
```

### Transcription Frequency
```python
# In app.py, stream_counter()
if idx % 3 == 0:  # Every 3 frames
    # Transcribe audio
```

### Language Detection
```python
# In app.py, transcribe_audio_segment()
"parameters": {
    "language": None  # Auto-detect (or set to "en", "es", etc.)
}
```

---

## 📦 Dependencies Added

```txt
moviepy>=1.0.3  # For audio extraction from video
```

**No ML libraries needed!** Using SageMaker means:
- ❌ No torch/transformers install
- ❌ No GPU required locally
- ❌ No model downloads
- ✅ Cloud-based inference
- ✅ Auto-scaling
- ✅ Production-ready

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Audio extraction fails?
```bash
# Install FFmpeg (required by moviepy)
# Mac:
brew install ffmpeg

# Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

### Endpoint not found?
```bash
# List your endpoints
aws sagemaker list-endpoints --region ap-southeast-2

# Check status
aws sagemaker describe-endpoint --endpoint-name YOUR_NAME
```

### High costs?
```bash
# Delete endpoint when not in use
aws sagemaker delete-endpoint --endpoint-name YOUR_NAME

# Re-deploy takes 5-10 minutes
```

## 🎓 Next Steps

1. **Deploy Whisper Endpoint** (see AUDIO_SETUP.md)
2. **Add endpoint name to .env**
3. **Restart server and test**
4. **Monitor costs in AWS Console**
5. **Delete endpoint when done testing**

## 🚀 Production Recommendations

For production deployment:

1. **Use Auto Scaling**
   - Min instances: 0
   - Max instances: 3
   - Scale based on invocations

2. **Enable Endpoint Monitoring**
   - CloudWatch metrics
   - Cost alerts
   - Performance tracking

3. **Implement Caching**
   - Cache transcriptions for duplicate audio
   - Redis/ElastiCache for multi-instance

4. **Batch Processing**
   - Extract all audio upfront
   - Batch transcribe in parallel
   - Faster for long videos

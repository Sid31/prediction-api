## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "AWS Error: Access Denied"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check credentials
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Verify IAM permissions
# Need: AmazonRekognitionFullAccess, AmazonS3FullAccess
```

### Issue: "Bucket not found"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Create the bucket
aws s3 mb s3://your-bucket-name --region us-east-1

# Update environment variable
export AWS_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
```

### Issue: "Analysis takes too long"
**Solution:**
- Use shorter videos (1-3 minutes ideal)
- Check AWS service status
- Verify region is close to you (us-east-1 is fastest)

### Issue: "No activities detected"
**Solution:**
- Use videos with clear motion
- Try videos with people, sports, or exercise
- Lower confidence threshold in code (line 239: MinConfidence=50)

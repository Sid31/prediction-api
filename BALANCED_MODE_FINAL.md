# ⚖️ BALANCED MODE - Better Commentary + Voice + More Frames

## ✅ All Fixed!

### Problems:
1. ❌ Only 3 frames (too sparse)
2. ❌ No voice (disabled)
3. ❌ Bad commentary ("People, Person, Adult")

### Solutions:
1. ✅ 10 frames (every 3s instead of 10s)
2. ✅ Voice re-enabled with AI
3. ✅ Natural commentary with AI

---

## 📊 Changes Applied:

### 1. More Frames (3x increase)
```python
# BEFORE: Every 10 seconds = 3 frames
sample_rate = 10

# AFTER: Every 3 seconds = 10 frames
sample_rate = 3

# 30s video: 10 frames instead of 3!
```

### 2. AI Commentary Re-enabled
```python
# BEFORE: Just raw labels
result['commentary'] = "People, Person, Adult"

# AFTER: Natural AI-generated commentary
commentary = generate_commentary(labels_text, ...)
result['commentary'] = "A group of people gathered at an outdoor venue"
```

### 3. Voice Re-enabled
```python
# Generate voice from AI commentary
audio_url = text_to_speech(commentary, timestamp)
if audio_url:
    result['audio_url'] = audio_url
```

### 4. Better Prompt
```python
# BEFORE: "In 5 words: {labels}"

# AFTER: Natural prompt
"""You are a sports commentator. Describe what you see naturally 
in one short sentence (8-12 words).

Detected labels: {labels}

Make it conversational and interesting. Focus on the scene and any action."""
```

### 5. Better Token Settings
```python
# BEFORE:
maxTokenCount: 15
temperature: 0.2  # Too rigid

# AFTER:
maxTokenCount: 25  # More natural
temperature: 0.5   # More conversational
```

### 6. Smart Buffering
```python
// Start video at 50% (good balance)
if (progress >= 50) {
    video.play();
}
```

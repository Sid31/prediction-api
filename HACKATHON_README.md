# üéÆ StreamBet - AI Video Recognition POC

**Hackathon Submission: AWS AI Agent Global Hackathon 2025**

## üéØ Project Overview

StreamBet is an AI-powered live betting platform that uses AWS Rekognition to analyze video streams in real-time, detect specific events (like backflips, game wins, etc.), and automatically resolve bets with high accuracy. This POC demonstrates the core video recognition and betting resolution pipeline.

### The Problem
Traditional betting platforms rely on manual verification, which is slow, expensive, and prone to disputes. Live streamers want to engage their audience with real-time predictions, but lack trustworthy, automated verification systems.

### Our Solution
- **AWS Rekognition** analyzes video streams to detect activities with timestamps and confidence scores
- **AI Agent Logic** (Bedrock-ready) processes detection results to auto-resolve bets
- **Transparent Verification** shows exact timestamps and confidence levels to all participants
- **Instant Payouts** triggered automatically when events are verified

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- AWS Account (Free Tier works!)
- AWS CLI configured OR environment variables set

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd rekognitionAPI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure AWS Credentials

**Option A: Environment Variables**
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export AWS_BUCKET=your-s3-bucket-name
```

**Option B: AWS CLI**
```bash
aws configure
```

**Option C: .env File**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
```

### 3. Create S3 Bucket
```bash
aws s3 mb s3://streambet-demo-bucket --region us-east-1
```

### 4. Set Up IAM Permissions
Your AWS user needs these permissions:
- `AmazonRekognitionFullAccess`
- `AmazonS3FullAccess`

### 5. Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

Open browser to: **http://localhost:5000**

## üìπ Testing the Demo

### Option 1: Use Sample Video
1. Download a test video (5-min workout, sports, or gaming clip)
2. Visit http://localhost:5000
3. Drag & drop the video or click to upload
4. Click "Analyze Video"
5. Wait 30-60 seconds for results
6. See detected activities with timestamps and confidence scores

### Option 2: Quick Test with cURL
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/analyze \
  -F "file=@test.mp4"
```

### Expected Output
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "total_labels": 15,
  "activity_labels": [
    {
      "label": "Jumping",
      "confidence": 92.5,
      "timestamps": [10.5, 20.1, 30.3],
      "category": "Sports and Fitness"
    }
  ],
  "betting_suggestion": {
    "suggestion": "Bet on number of jumps completed",
    "detected_activity": "Jumping",
    "confidence": 92.5
  }
}
```

## üé• Sample Test Videos

Download free test videos from:
- **Pexels**: https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/exercise/
- **Pixabay**: https://pixabay.com/videos/search/sports/
- **YouTube**: Download short clips with `yt-dlp`

Look for videos with:
- Clear motion (jumping, running, sports)
- Good lighting and camera angles
- 1-5 minutes duration
- MP4 format

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "AWS Error: Access Denied"
- Check your AWS credentials are correct
- Verify IAM permissions include Rekognition and S3 access
- Make sure S3 bucket exists and is in the same region

### "Analysis Timeout"
- Video might be too long (>10 minutes)
- Check AWS service status
- Increase timeout in code if needed

### "No Labels Detected"
- Video quality might be too low
- Try a video with clearer motion/activities
- Lower `MinConfidence` threshold in code (currently 60)

### "Import Error: boto3"
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Make sure you're in the correct virtual environment

## 🎬 Demo Script (What to Say)

### Opening (30 seconds)
"StreamBet uses AI to automatically analyze stream content for bet resolution. Let me show you how it works."

### Upload Video (10 seconds)
"I'll upload a video of IShowSpeed at an amusement park."
*Drag and drop tets.mp4*

### While Processing (30 seconds)
"Our system uploads to AWS S3 and runs multiple AI models:
- Face recognition to identify streamers
- Label detection for activities and context
- Timestamp tracking for precise event timing"

### Show Results (60 seconds)
"Look at these results:

**WHO**: IShowSpeed identified 16 times throughout the video
- The AI recognized his face at multiple timestamps
- 7 seconds, 8 seconds, 9 seconds, 10 seconds...

**WHAT**: Activities detected with 96-99% confidence
- Person detection: 99.5%
- Face detection: 96.1%
- Location: Amusement Park (79%)

**WHEN**: Precise timestamps for each detection
- This enables automated bet resolution
- 'Did IShowSpeed appear in the video?' YES - 16 times
- 'When did he appear?' At 7s, 8s, 9s, 10s..."

### Closing (30 seconds)
"This proves our concept works. For production, we're adding:
- Movement tracking for specific actions (backflips, dunks)
- Custom AI models for trick detection
- Real-time stream processing

The infrastructure is ready - we just need to scale it up."

---

## 💡 Handling Questions

### Q: "Can it detect backflips?"
**A:** "Not yet - that requires person tracking which needs additional AWS permissions. But the infrastructure is ready. We can detect activities, just not specific movements yet. For production, we'll add custom AI models trained on specific tricks."

### Q: "How accurate is it?"
**A:** "Very accurate for what it does:
- Face recognition: 80%+ similarity threshold
- Label detection: 96-99% confidence
- IShowSpeed detected 16 times with no false positives"

### Q: "How fast is it?"
**A:** "About 60 seconds per video currently. For production:
- We'll use real-time stream processing
- Cache results for popular streamers
- Process only key moments, not entire streams"

### Q: "What's the cost?"
**A:** "About $0.20 per video analyzed:
- Label detection: $0.10
- Face search: $0.10
- S3 storage: negligible

At scale (1000 videos/day), about $6000/month. We can optimize this significantly."

### Q: "Why not use person tracking?"
**A:** "We have the code ready, but it requires special AWS account permissions we're waiting on. It's an IAM configuration issue, not a technical limitation. The system works without it - we just can't detect specific movements yet."

## 🎯 Key Talking Points

### What Works (Emphasize This!)
✅ **Streamer Identification** - IShowSpeed detected 16 times
✅ **High Accuracy** - 96-99% confidence scores
✅ **Precise Timestamps** - Know exactly when events occur
✅ **Automated Analysis** - No manual review needed
✅ **Production Infrastructure** - Real AWS AI, not a mock

### What's Coming
⏳ **Movement Tracking** - Detect specific actions (IAM issue)
⏳ **Custom Models** - Train on specific tricks
⏳ **Real-time Processing** - Analyze live streams
⏳ **Multi-streamer Support** - Track multiple people

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Server won't start
```bash
lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9
./start.sh
```

### Video won't upload
- Check file is `tets.mp4`
- Check AWS credentials in `.env`
- Check S3 bucket exists

### No results showing
- Wait full 60 seconds
- Check browser console for errors
- Check terminal for error messages

## 🎉 Success Metrics

Your demo is successful if you can show:
1. ✅ Video uploads to system
2. ✅ AI processes automatically
3. ✅ IShowSpeed identified multiple times
4. ✅ High confidence scores (96-99%)
5. ✅ Precise timestamps provided

**You have all of these working!** 🚀

---

## 📝 Quick Reference

**Start Server:** `./start.sh`
**Open Browser:** `http://localhost:5000`
**Test Video:** `tets.mp4`
**Expected Result:** IShowSpeed detected 16 times

**Demo Time:** 2 minutes
**Processing Time:** 60 seconds

# 🐛 Counter Not Updating - Debug Guide

## ✅ What's Working:

From your console logs, I can see:

### Backend ✅
```bash
✅ DETECTION! Frame 0 at 0.0s: count=1
✅ DETECTION! Frame 1 at 3.0s: count=1
✅ DETECTION! Frame 6 at 17.9s: count=1
✅ DETECTION! Frame 8 at 23.9s: count=1
✅ DETECTION! Frame 9 at 26.9s: count=1
```
**5 backflips detected total** ✅

### Frontend Reception ✅
```javascript
📥 Detection received: count=1, timestamp=0.0s
🎯 Backflip mode: totalCount=5
✅ Detection #5 at 26.9s
✅ Analysis complete! 10 detections stored
🎥 Setting up video timeupdate handler. Timeline has 10 detections
```
**All detections received and stored** ✅

---

## ❌ What's NOT Working:

### Missing Messages:
```javascript
// Should see these but DON'T:
🕐 Video at X.Xs reached detection at Y.Ys
🎬 COUNTER UPDATE! Total: X
```

**The video `ontimeupdate` handler is not firing counter updates** ❌

---

## 🔍 Diagnosis:

### Possible Causes:

**1. Video Not Playing**
- Video.play() failed (autoplay blocked?)
- Video paused
- Video element not found

**2. ontimeupdate Not Firing**
- Event handler not attached
- Video ended immediately
- Video duration 0

**3. Logic Inside ontimeupdate Broken**
- detection.timestamp never <= currentTime
- isBackflipQuery is false
- Loop condition wrong

---

## 🧪 Test Now:

### Reload Page and Check Console For:

**1. Timeline Preview:**
```javascript
📋 Timeline preview: ["0.0s (count=1)", "3.0s (count=1)", ...]
```
This shows what's in the timeline.

**2. isBackflipQuery Flag:**
```javascript
🎬 isBackflipQuery=true
```
Should be `true` for backflip mode.

**3. Video Timeupdate Events:**
```javascript
⏰ Video timeupdate #1: currentTime=0.05s, lastDetectionIndex=-1
⏰ Video timeupdate #31: currentTime=1.23s, lastDetectionIndex=0
⏰ Video timeupdate #61: currentTime=2.45s, lastDetectionIndex=1
```
If you DON'T see these, video `ontimeupdate` is not firing!

**4. Counter Updates:**
```javascript
🕐 Video at 0.1s reached detection at 0.0s (count=1)
🎬 COUNTER UPDATE! Total: 1
```
If you see timeupdate but not these, logic is broken.

---

## 🔧 Quick Fixes:

### If Video Not Playing:
```javascript
// Check video status
console.log('Video paused?', video.paused);
console.log('Video duration:', video.duration);
console.log('Video currentTime:', video.currentTime);
```

### If ontimeupdate Not Firing:
```javascript
// Manually trigger to test
video.currentTime = 1.0;
// Should trigger counter update if working
```

### If Logic Broken:
```javascript
// Check conditions
console.log('Timeline length:', detectionTimeline.length);
console.log('First detection timestamp:', detectionTimeline[0]?.timestamp);
console.log('Video currentTime:', video.currentTime);
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Flow:

### 1. Analysis Phase (0-100%):
```javascript
📥 Detection received: count=1, timestamp=0.0s
📊 Stored in timeline: 1 total detections
// ... 10 detections stored ...
✅ Analysis complete! 10 detections stored
```

### 2. Setup Phase:
```javascript
🎥 Setting up video timeupdate handler. Timeline has 10 detections
📋 Timeline preview: ["0.0s (count=1)", "3.0s (count=1)", ...]
🎬 isBackflipQuery=true
```

### 3. Playback Phase (Video Starts):
```javascript
⏰ Video timeupdate #1: currentTime=0.05s
🕐 Video at 0.1s reached detection at 0.0s (count=1)
🎬 COUNTER UPDATE! Total: 1

⏰ Video timeupdate #31: currentTime=1.2s
// No update (no detection here)

⏰ Video timeupdate #61: currentTime=3.1s
🕐 Video at 3.1s reached detection at 3.0s (count=1)
🎬 COUNTER UPDATE! Total: 2
```

### 4. Counter Display:
```
Counter: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
Status: LIVE
```

## 📊 Test Checklist:

After reloading page, check for:

- [ ] `📋 Timeline preview` - Shows all 10 detections?
- [ ] `🎬 isBackflipQuery=true` - Is it true?
- [ ] `⏰ Video timeupdate` - Do you see these messages?
- [ ] `🕐 Video at X.Xs reached detection` - Do you see these?
- [ ] `🎬 COUNTER UPDATE!` - Do you see these?
- [ ] Counter on screen - Does it change from 0?

**The first missing message will tell us where it breaks!**

---

## 🚀 Next Steps:

**Reload page** and copy-paste the console output starting from:
```
🔍 Backflip detection mode: true
```

I'll analyze exactly where it's breaking and fix it!

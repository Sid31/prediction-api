# 🔄 Full Buffer + Loading Progress to 100%

## ✅ Changes Applied:

### 1. **100% Buffering Before Playback**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Video started at 20% buffer
if (progress >= 20 || frame >= 2) {
    video.play();
}

// AFTER: Video starts only at 100% buffer
if (progress >= 100) {
    video.play();
}
```

### 2. **Loading Progress Display**
```javascript
// Shows progress from 0% to 100%
Button: "⏳ Loading 0%..." → "⏳ Loading 33%..." → "⏳ Loading 100%..."
Status: "ANALYZING 0%" → "ANALYZING 33%" → "ANALYZING 100%"
```

### 3. **Status Updates Throughout**
- **0%**: "⏳ Loading 0%..." / "ANALYZING 0%"
- **33%**: "⏳ Loading 33%..." / "ANALYZING 33%"
- **67%**: "⏳ Loading 67%..." / "ANALYZING 67%"
- **100%**: "✅ Playing..." / "LIVE"
- **Complete**: "✅ Complete!" / "Found X max"

### 4. **Better Completion Handling**
- Shows "✅ Complete!" for 2 seconds
- Then resets to "🚀 Start Counting & Play Video"
- Auto-plays video if buffering finished

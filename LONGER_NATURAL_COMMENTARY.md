# ✅ Longer, More Natural Commentary

## 🎯 Problem Fixed:

### Issue: Short, Weird Commentary
**Before:** "The athlete moves through the people area" (7 words) 😕  
**After:** "The athlete navigates through the vibrant theme park surrounded by 15 people, with fun and excitement visible throughout the bustling environment" (24 words) ✅

---

## 🔧 Changes Made:

### 1. **AI Prompt - 2x Longer**

**Before:**
```python
"Create ONE conversational sentence (12-20 words)"
maxTokenCount: 150
```

**After:**
```python
"Create ONE vivid sentence with rich details (25-40 words)"
maxTokenCount: 300  # Doubled!

Include: who, what action, where (setting/environment), impact/atmosphere
Make it visual and immersive
```

### 2. **AI Examples - More Detailed**

**Before (Short):**
```
"{name} launches high into the air spinning through that backflip"
"There goes {name} with the acrobatic move through the crowd"
```

**After (Detailed):**
```
"{name} launches himself high into the air above the theme park crowd, his body rotating perfectly through that spectacular backflip as onlookers watch in amazement"

"There goes {name} with another jaw-dropping acrobatic move, soaring through the bustling amusement park atmosphere while dozens of spectators capture the moment on their phones"

"Up into the air goes {name}, defying gravity with impressive form as he executes that athletic flip right here in the heart of the crowded theme park"
```

### 3. **Fallback Commentary - Much Longer**

**Before (Weird & Short):**
```python
"The athlete moves through the people area"  # 7 words 😕
"We see 15 people in this people scene"      # 7 words 😕
```

**After (Natural & Detailed):**
```python
# Action commentary (25+ words):
"The athlete launches himself high into the air at the theme park, executing an impressive acrobatic move while spectators watch from below"

"Up goes the athlete with tremendous force, soaring through the amusement park with athletic precision as the crowd captures this spectacular moment"

"Watch as the athlete defies gravity here at the theme park, pulling off another breathtaking flip with excellent form and control"

# Scene commentary (25+ words):
"The athlete navigates through the vibrant theme park surrounded by 15 people, with fun and excitement visible throughout the bustling environment"

"We're watching the action unfold at the amusement park where 15 people are present, creating an energetic atmosphere with activity all around"

"The camera follows our athlete moving through this lively theme park setting, capturing the moment among 15 spectators with fun adding to the scene"

# ⏳ Rate Limit Protection - Fixed!

## ✅ Problem Fixed:

**Error:** "Too many requests, please wait before trying again"  
**Cause:** AWS Bedrock API rate limits hit from rapid commentary requests  

---

## 🔧 Solutions Applied:

### 1. **Reduced Commentary Frequency**
```python
# BEFORE: Every 2 frames (5 commentaries per 30s video)
if idx % 2 == 0 and idx > 0:
    commentary = generate_commentary(...)

# AFTER: Every 3 frames (3-4 commentaries per 30s video)
if idx % 3 == 0 and idx > 0:
    commentary = generate_commentary(...)
```

**Impact:**
- 30s video: 5 API calls → 3 API calls (40% reduction)
- 60s video: 10 API calls → 6 API calls (40% reduction)

### 2. **Exponential Backoff Retry**
```python
max_retries = 3
base_delay = 1

for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        response = bedrock_client.invoke_model(...)
        return commentary
    except Exception as api_error:
        if 'Too many requests' in str(api_error):
            delay = base_delay * (2 ** attempt)  # 1s, 2s, 4s
            print(f"⏳ Rate limited, waiting {delay}s...")
            time.sleep(delay)
            continue  # Retry
```

**Retry Pattern:**
- 1st attempt: Immediate
- 2nd attempt: Wait 1 second
- 3rd attempt: Wait 2 seconds
- 4th attempt: Wait 4 seconds
- After 3 retries: Skip commentary

### 3. **Request Spacing**
```python
# Add 500ms delay between API calls
time.sleep(0.5)
commentary = generate_commentary(...)
```

**Impact:**
- Prevents burst requests
- Spreads load over time
- More AWS-friendly

### 4. **Graceful Fallback**
```python
# If AI commentary fails, use simple labels
if not commentary:
    top_labels = [l['name'] for l in labels_data[:5]]
    commentary = f"{person_count} person(s) detected with {', '.join(top_labels[:3])}"
    print(f"📝 Using simple commentary (no AI)")
```

**Result:**
- Always get commentary (even if rate limited)
- Voice still works with simple commentary
- No errors stop the process

## 📊 Rate Limit Protection Strategy:

### Multi-Layer Protection:

**Layer 1: Reduce Frequency**
```
Every 3 frames instead of every 2 frames
= 40% fewer API calls
```

**Layer 2: Request Spacing**
```
500ms delay between requests
= No burst patterns
```

**Layer 3: Exponential Backoff**
```
1s → 2s → 4s waits on rate limit
= Automatic recovery
```

**Layer 4: Graceful Fallback**
```
Simple label commentary if AI fails
= Always works
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior:

### Normal Operation:
```bash
📝 Generating commentary for frame 3...
🤖 Generating commentary with prompt length: 156
✅ Commentary generated: Scene shows person in outdoor setting...
🎤 Converting to speech: Scene shows person in...
🔊 Voice audio saved: commentary_9000.mp3
```

### Rate Limited (With Recovery):
```bash
📝 Generating commentary for frame 3...
🤖 Generating commentary with prompt length: 156
⏳ Rate limited, waiting 1s before retry 1/3...
✅ Commentary generated: Scene shows person in outdoor setting...
🎤 Converting to speech: Scene shows person in...
```

### Rate Limited (Fallback):
```bash
📝 Generating commentary for frame 3...
🤖 Generating commentary with prompt length: 156
⏳ Rate limited, waiting 1s before retry 1/3...
⏳ Rate limited, waiting 2s before retry 2/3...
⏳ Rate limited, waiting 4s before retry 3/3...
❌ Max retries reached, skipping commentary
📝 Using simple commentary (no AI)
🎙️ Commentary: 1 person(s) detected with Person, Jumping, Sport
🎤 Converting to speech: 1 person(s) detected with...
```

**Voice always works! 🔊**

## 💡 Performance Impact:

### Before (Rate Limited):
```
Frame 1: ✅ AI commentary
Frame 2: ✅ AI commentary
Frame 3: ❌ Rate limit error → Process stops
Frame 4: Never reached
Frame 5: Never reached
```

### After (Protected):
```
Frame 1: ⏭️ Skipped (idx % 3 != 0)
Frame 2: ⏭️ Skipped
Frame 3: ✅ AI commentary (with retry if needed)
Frame 4: ⏭️ Skipped
Frame 5: ⏭️ Skipped
Frame 6: ✅ Simple fallback (if rate limited)
Frame 7: ⏭️ Skipped
Frame 8: ⏭️ Skipped
Frame 9: ✅ AI commentary (recovered!)
Frame 10: Complete ✅
```

## 🎮 Commentary Frequency:

### 30s Video (10 frames):
```
Frame 0 (0s):   No commentary
Frame 1 (3s):   No commentary
Frame 2 (6s):   No commentary
Frame 3 (9s):   ✅ Commentary + Voice
Frame 4 (12s):  No commentary
Frame 5 (15s):  No commentary
Frame 6 (18s):  ✅ Commentary + Voice
Frame 7 (21s):  No commentary
Frame 8 (24s):  No commentary
Frame 9 (27s):  ✅ Commentary + Voice
Frame 10 (30s): No commentary

Total: 3 commentaries (was 5)
```

## ⚙️ AWS Rate Limits:

### Typical Bedrock Limits:
- **Transactions per second**: 5-10 TPS
- **Burst capacity**: 20-30 requests
- **Throttling**: After burst, enforced rate limit

### Our Protection:
- **Request rate**: ~0.3 TPS (1 every 3 frames × 3s = 9s)
- **Spacing**: 500ms between requests
- **Retry**: Exponential backoff on throttle
- **Fallback**: Simple commentary if all fails

**Well below rate limits! ✅**

## 🔍 Debug Logs:

### Check for Rate Limits:
```bash
# Look for these messages:
⏳ Rate limited, waiting 1s before retry 1/3...
⏳ Rate limited, waiting 2s before retry 2/3...
❌ Max retries reached, skipping commentary
📝 Using simple commentary (no AI)
```

### Success Messages:
```bash
✅ Commentary generated: ...
🎤 Converting to speech: ...
🔊 Voice audio saved: ...
```

## 🚀 Restart and Test:

```bash
# Restart server
python3 app.py

# Test with IShowSpeed video

# Expected: 
- Fewer API calls (every 3 frames)
- Automatic retry if rate limited
- Simple fallback if all retries fail
- Voice always works!
```

| **API calls per 30s video** | 5 | 3 | -40% |
| **Request spacing** | None | 500ms | Added |
| **Retry on rate limit** | No | Yes (3x) | Added |
| **Fallback commentary** | None | Simple labels | Added |
| **Process stops on error** | Yes | No | Fixed |
| **Voice works always** | No | Yes | Fixed |

## ✅ Summary:

**Problems:**
- ❌ Too many API requests
- ❌ No retry logic
- ❌ Process stops on rate limit
- ❌ No fallback commentary

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Reduced to every 3 frames (40% fewer)
- ✅ Exponential backoff retry (1s, 2s, 4s)
- ✅ Request spacing (500ms delays)
- ✅ Simple fallback commentary
- ✅ Voice always works

**Result:** Robust, rate-limit-proof commentary system! 🎯✅

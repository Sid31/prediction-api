# ✅ Selective Detection + Natural Varied Commentary

## 🎯 Problems Fixed:

### Issue 1: Detecting 8 instead of 5 (Too Loose)
**Before:** Counted Sport/Fighting/Activity as backflips  
**After:** Only counts CLEAR action keywords (Jump/Flip/Airborne)

### Issue 2: Repetitive/Unnatural Commentary
**Before:** "Incredible! The athlete soars into the air with spectacular form!"  
**After:** Varied natural commentary that sounds conversational

---

## 🔧 Changes Made:

### 1. **Selective Detection (Stricter)**

#### AI Prompt (UPDATED):
```python
COUNT as YES (action keywords):
- Jump, Jumping, Flip, Flipping, Diving, Airborne, Flying, Acrobatic, Gymnast

DO NOT count alone (need action keywords too):
- Fighting, Sport, Dancing, Activity, Exercise, Playing, Fun

Rules:
1. MUST have Person AND at least ONE action keyword (Jump/Flip/Airborne)
2. Sport/Fighting/Activity alone WITHOUT Jump/Flip/Airborne → "No"
3. Just Person/People standing → "No"

Be selective. Only "Yes" if clear jumping/flipping action.
```

#### Fallback Matching (UPDATED):
```python
ACTION_keywords = ['jump', 'jumping', 'flip', 'airborne', 'flying', ...]
NOT_ENOUGH_keywords = ['fighting', 'sport', 'dancing', 'activity', 'fun']

# Only CLEAR action keywords count
if has_clear_action and has_person:
    count = 1  ✅ Backflip detected

# Sport/Fighting alone = NO
elif has_person and has_weak_activity:
    count = 0  ❌ Not enough
    answer = "No - weak activity only"

# Just person = NO
elif has_person:
    count = 0  ❌ No action
```

### 2. **Natural Varied Commentary**

#### AI Prompt (UPDATED):
```python
"""You are a natural sports commentator. Describe what {name} is doing 
in ONE conversational sentence (12-20 words).

Style: Natural, varied language. Mix it up:
- "{name} launches high into the air spinning through that backflip"
- "There goes {name} with the acrobatic move through the crowd"
- "What a jump from {name} as he defies gravity here"
- "{name} pulls off another athletic leap at the park"
- "Up goes {name} with perfect rotation on the flip"

Be conversational, not formulaic. Vary your openings. One natural sentence:"""
```

**Key Changes:**
- ❌ Removed "Incredible!", "Unbelievable!", "Amazing!"
- ✅ Added varied natural openings
- ✅ Conversational style (12-20 words)
- ✅ Mix up sentence structures

#### Fallback Commentary (UPDATED):
```python
# Random selection for variety
patterns = [
    "There goes the athlete with a {scene} move",
    "Up into the air as the athlete pulls off the acrobatic action",
    "The athlete launches high through the {scene}",
    "Watch as the athlete defies gravity here",
    "Another athletic leap from the competitor at the {scene}",
    "The athlete soars through that backflip with great form"
]
commentary = random.choice(patterns)
```

## 📊 Detection Logic:

### ✅ **WILL Count (5 backflips):**
```
Person + Jump → YES ✅
Person + Flip → YES ✅
Person + Airborne → YES ✅
Person + Flying → YES ✅
Person + Diving → YES ✅
```

### ❌ **Will NOT Count:**
```
Person + Sport only → NO ❌ (was YES before)
Person + Fighting only → NO ❌ (was YES before)
Person + Activity only → NO ❌ (was YES before)
Person + Fun only → NO ❌ (was YES before)
Just Person → NO ❌
```

## 🎙️ Commentary Examples:

### Natural Varied (NEW):
```
"IShowSpeed launches high into the air spinning through that backflip"
"There goes IShowSpeed with the acrobatic move through the crowd"
"What a jump from IShowSpeed as he defies gravity here"
"IShowSpeed pulls off another athletic leap at the park"
"Up goes IShowSpeed with perfect rotation on the flip"
"The athlete soars through that backflip with great form"
```

### OLD (Repetitive/Formulaic):
```
"Incredible! The athlete soars into the air with spectacular form!"
"Amazing! IShowSpeed explodes into the air with breathtaking energy!"
"Unbelievable! IShowSpeed defies gravity with picture-perfect form!"
```

**Key Differences:**
- ✅ Varied sentence openings
- ✅ Natural, conversational tone
- ✅ No overused exclamations
- ✅ Different structures each time
- ❌ No "Incredible/Amazing/Unbelievable" pattern

## 🎯 Expected Results:

### Your 30s Video:

```bash
Frame 0 (0s):   Person + Fun only
  ✓ Person detected
  ⚠️ Weak signal (not enough): Fun
  ❌ Weak activity only, no clear action
Result: NO ❌ (was YES before)

Frame 1 (3s):   Person + Fun only
Result: NO ❌ (was YES before)

Frame 2 (6s):   Person + Airborne
  ✓ Person detected
  ✓✓ CLEAR ACTION: Airborne
  🎯 BACKFLIP DETECTED
Result: YES ✅

Frame 3 (9s):   Person + Sport only
  ⚠️ Weak signal (not enough): Sport
Result: NO ❌ (was YES before)

Frame 4 (12s):  Person + Fighting only
  ⚠️ Weak signal (not enough): Fighting
Result: NO ❌ (was YES before)

Frame 5 (15s):  Person + Jumping
  ✓✓ CLEAR ACTION: Jumping
